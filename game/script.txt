Duration: 20 + 5 minutes.


First of all, a sound test because this talk will involve some audio panning. 
Can you hear the sound go from left to right? Alright.

Hi! My name is Alfred and welcome to my tech talk!

A little bit about myself, I've been working with Ren'Py for over 7 years now.
I've worked as a solo developer in Usagi Syndrome, lead developer in Mycorrhiza,
Porting programmer in Save Me Sakuya-san, Ren'Py teacher in university club I studied at for a year, 
and took parts on other VN projects.
Aside from Ren'Py, I've used GameMaker Studio for some time now and a tiny bit of Unity. 

In this talk, I am partnered with Tim Reichert. 
In case you didn't know, he is an sound engineer, composer, audio director, and a musicologist.
He is also the lead developer and writer in Mycorrhiza VN. 
Last year in VN Conference 2023, he did a talk about what dynamic audio is, so this talk is to expand it further.
If you have any audio-specific questions, Tim will help answer that for you.

A friendly warning, because this talk is oriented on the technical side,
Ren'Py and Python codes are used in this talk; along with some math too.
I will try my best to keep the codes and math at minimum and to make them more digestable. 
One last thing, the source code and this talk script is available on GitHub link in the chat.
Inside it there's a bonus section for supplementary and unused shenanigan when making this talk.

That's that for the introduction. Now, into the topic.
There will be three main sections to this talk, from review on what dynamic audio is, Ren'Py screens, and four scenario cases.

First of all, what is dynamic audio?
Here I quote the definition from Tim, "Dynamic audio is ...".
This means that audio that is playing can be affected by player's interaction or by random chances.
