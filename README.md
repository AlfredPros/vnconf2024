# Dynamic Audio Implementation With Ren'Py

Slides for AlfredPros' talk in VNConf 2024. This slide is made using Ranim template.

## Usage

Since this project contains matrixcolor ATL, you should run this on Ren'Py `7.4.x` or above. Due to the newer button behavior change in Ren'Py `7.5.2`/`8.0.2`, 
it is advised to run this project in between version `7.4.x` to `7.5.1`/`8.0.1`.

## About Ranim

A manim-inspired Ren'Py template for presentation and animation. Ranim is a personal project I made while making this VNConf 2024 slides project. 
The project is still unreleased as of right now.
However, you are free to use the current version of Ranim from what I had in this project.
